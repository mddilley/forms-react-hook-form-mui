# React Hook Form + Material UI

## Mission: Make forms easy for everyone 🎉

## 🚀👩‍🚀 Discovery Day v4 👨‍🚀🚀

---

# Forms

## They sound easy. 📝 ✅ = 😃

## They're not. ⏭️ ❎❓🔙 🚫 = 😕

---

<h1>Features We Want</h1>

<center><p>Validation: We want to store high quality data so we need to ensure valid inputs.</p></center>

<center><p>Fetching options: Options change so we need to request them from a database that is the source of truth.</p></center>

<center><p>Autocomplete: Make long lists of options easier to enter.</p></center>

<center><p>Funneling: Choose You Own Adventure 🏰🛡️🐉</p></center>

---

# Other Challenges

<center><p>Lots of libraries with lots of promises. 🤞</p></center>

<center><p>Bonus Challenge! Make forms easy for the whole team to build - regardless of proficiency with a framework or code skill.</p></center>

---

# Component libraries like Material UI

<center><p>Create reusable building blocks to easily create forms 🏗️</p></center>

<center><p>Create a consistent look and feel throughout an app ✨</p></center>

<center><p>Opinionated so we have less decisions to make = less work 🙌</p></center>
<center><p>...but we have to fight against built-in opinions sometimes ⚔️</p></center>

---

# React Hook Form

<center><p>React conventions say to keep track of form values within React ⚛️</p></center>
<center><p>React Hook Form leans on existing HTML functionality to track those values 🧠</p></center>
<center>Reduce code complexity 👍</center>
<center>More performant 🏎️</center>
<center>Increase development speed 🏎️</center>

# What I learned
- It takes time to set up initially
- Fast development after initial work
- Capture this work by creating components built with components
- Less code complexity
- React Hook Form has dev tools and a builder

---

# Hard and not so great things
- Both react-hook-form and Material UI have a learning curve
- Material UI’s opinions made using it along with react-hook-form difficult at times
- Performance issues with long lists
